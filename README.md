Automated Greenhouse Project

This project presents the development of a small-scale automated greenhouse model using the Arduino platform. The primary objective is to control and optimize key growing conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors critical to crop growth. By automating these processes, the system aims to minimize energy consumption, enhance the precision of environmental measurements, and, as a result, improve both the yield and quality of crops.

The project demonstrates how such automation can resolve common challenges found in traditional greenhouses, such as inconsistent climate control and inefficient resource use, leading to economic savings and a more sustainable approach to agriculture. This solution incorporates a variety of sensors (temperature, humidity, and others) to monitor the internal conditions of the greenhouse and adjust them automatically to ensure optimal growth conditions for the plants.
